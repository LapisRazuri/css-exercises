Assignments given in Odin project

Through completeing assignments given in 3-CSS-Practice, I was able to learn how to change the color of the text, make them bold, also, how to use multiple class in one element (class="bold color background"), and the difference between the class and id. Currently, I am learning @font-family which I quite don't understand properly.
